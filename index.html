<h1>Quinton Kolb</h1>
<h2>Software Engineer</h2>
<br>
<p>My name is Quinton Kolb and I am a software engineer. I have a passion for creating software that is both functional and user-friendly. I am currently working on a project that will help people find the perfect pet for their family. I am excited to see where this project takes me and I am looking forward to sharing it with the world.</p>
<br>
<p>When I am not coding, I enjoy spending time with my family and friends. I also love to travel and explore new places. I am always looking for new adventures and new challenges to take on. I am excited to see where my career as a software engineer will take me and I am looking forward to all of the opportunities that lie ahead.</p>
